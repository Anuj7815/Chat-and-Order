*********************Workflow of the website********************

1. Signup-> When user signup then at backend 4 cases can arise
-> 409: user email already exists 
-> 400: bad request, for some reason response cannot be handled 
-> 201: user successfully created.
-> 500: Internal Server Error

-> Based on the four cases frontend handles the code and shows it on the UI/console.
-> If success: setting isAuth and user data into the localStorage
